#IBM Watson
========================================


This project contains a few very basic and examples on how to use some of the IBM Watson Cloud services API in Python.

These examples are in Python 2.7. Some of them are generic and should work on any flavor of Linux, and some examples were written specifically for the Raspberry Pi on Raspbian.

## Requirements:

* **IBM Bluemix Credentials** - These examples assume that you have already obtained IBM Bluemix credentials for each particular service you intend to use. For more details, go to https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/services-catalog.html


## Additional Resources

For more advanced uses, you may want to consider using the IBM Watson python SDK available at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk
